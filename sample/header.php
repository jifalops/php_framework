<?php
/* 
 * header.php
 * The purpose of this file is to be included at the beginning
 * of every PHP file (except classes, which go in the library
 * directory). That will ensure that pages within the site work
 * consistently. To include it, the preferred method would be:
 *
 *  require_once('header.php');
 * 
 *  -or-
 *
 *  require_once('../header.php');
 *
 * The second example above is how to include this file from a file
 * in a sub-directory. ".." represents the parent directory and can
 * be used repeatedly (i.e. '../../../header.php').
